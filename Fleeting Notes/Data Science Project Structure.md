Here is an explanation of each directory:
- `data/`: This directory contains all the data used in the project.
- `raw/`: This directory contains the raw, unprocessed data.
- `processed/`: This directory contains the processed data that has been cleaned, transformed, and saved in a format suitable for analysis.
- `interim/`: This directory contains intermediate data generated while processing the data and is used in later stages.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the project.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, visualization, and prototyping.
- `scripts/`: This directory contains Python or other scripts used for processing and cleaning data, training models, and other tasks.
- `modules/`: This directory contains any custom Python modules or packages that are used in the project.
- `models/`: This directory contains the saved models, along with any scripts or notebooks used to train and evaluate the models.  
- `reports/`: This directory contains any reports or presentations generated for the project.
- `images/`: This directory contains any images or visualizations used in the project.   
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to run the code.   
- `.gitignore`: This file is used by Git to determine which files and directories should be ignored, such as large data files or files containing sensitive information.  

This is just a suggested structure and can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the project. The goal is to have a organized and well-structured project that makes it easy for others to understand and reproduce your work.

# DS Project Readme.md Structure
Here is the description of what should be included in the `README.md` file of a data science project on GitHub:
1.  Project Description: Briefly explain what is being attempted in this project, how the data is being used, and what the expected end results are.
2.  Installation Instructions: Explain how others can set up their environment to run this project, including information on required packages, dependencies, and installation steps.
3.  Usage Instructions: Explain how others can run the code and use the data in this project.
4.  Project Structure: Explain the structure of folders and files in the project, and the function of each file and folder.
5.  Credits and References: Include the names and links to sources of data or other resources used in this project. Also, include the names and links to packages or modules used.
6.  License: Include information about the license used in this project, including copyright and code licensing.
7.  Contribution: If this project allows for contributions from others, explain how others can contribute, such as through forking, pull requests, or bug reporting.

These are some of the essential things that should be included in the `README.md` file of a data science project on GitHub. Of course, every project has different needs, so make sure to include relevant and important information for your project.

# DS Presentation Stakeholders
Here is the presentation structure thaa data scientist can usest can results of a data science project to stakeholders or business teams that are unfamiliar with data science:
1. Introduction: Explain why data science is important to the business and how this project contributes to the business.
2.  Background: Explain the background of the project, including its objectives and the expected benefits.
3.  Data Description: Explain the source of the data used, the size of the data, and the characteristics of the data. Also, show data visualizations that help the audience understand the data.
4.  Data Analysis: Explain the methods used to analyze the data, including descriptive statistics and data modeling. Also, show visualizations that demonstrate the results of the data analysis.
5.  Results: Explain the results of the data analysis, including any insights discovered, hypotheses proven or disproven, and recommendations that can be given.
6.  Use: Explain how the project results can be used to solve business problems or improve business performance.
7.  Implications: Explain the implications of the project results, including what should be done next and how the results of the project can help the business make better decisions.
8.  Conclusion: Summarize the results of the project and how the project met its objectives.
9.  Q&A: Allow time for questions and discussion of the project results with the audience.
    
Make sure to create a presentation that is easy to understand and engaging for an audience that is unfamiliar with data science. Use visualizations and analogies to help make data science concepts easier to understand.
