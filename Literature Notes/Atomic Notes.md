#Study

Life is short, and we should do something more rather than study. Do not take too much time to worry about your notes because the information is the one that matters. To make your note not forgettable, make it atomic rather than sequentially. The atomic mean is more about concepts and linking those concepts. This atomic or conceptual note-taking technique will make you more creative. And also, this technique is aligned with the first principle of thinking.
