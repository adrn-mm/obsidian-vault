Basically Zettelkasten is divided to three main components: Fleeting, Literature, and Permanent note. Fleeting note is about list of points about your ideas, Literature note is about re-telling author's points from your interpretation, and then Permanent Note is re-written to link these interpretation with what you already have. All of these notes  should be atomic, follow this steps in this note: [[Atomic Notes]].
